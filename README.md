This project simulates and visualizes hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle, comparing individuals with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) to those with typical (eumenorrheic) cycles. By modeling key reproductive hormones—including luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, and progesterone—this simulation highlights the disrupted patterns seen in PCOS, such as elevated LH/FSH ratios, anovulation, and reduced progesterone production.

The goal of the simulation is to provide a clear, side-by-side view of hormonal dynamics to deepen understanding of how PCOS alters the endocrine system. This project can serve as a foundational tool for researchers, students, health tech developers, or anyone interested in building more personalized, hormone-aware solutions in women’s health. It also lays the groundwork for integrating hormonal models into adaptive tracking apps.
